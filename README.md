## 🌟 Overview

Hi guys, this is a Student's Performance Predictor, my first ML project. I am a third-year economics major at the University of Delhi. For the past few months, I've been aggressively trying to implement various econometric learnings on a practical dataset.

This project is an extensive part of that journey, combining statistical rigor with practical application to create meaningful predictions about student academic outcomes.
