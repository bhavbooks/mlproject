Hi guys, this is a Student's Performance Predictor, my first ML project.
I am a third-year economics major at the University of Delhi. For the past few months, I've been aggressively trying to implement various econometric learnings on a practical dataset.

This project is an extensive part of that.

I will update this section when required.
Thank You

Note: The beautiful web UI is the result of very small prompts given to the claude. The main aim was to implement the statistical methods!
